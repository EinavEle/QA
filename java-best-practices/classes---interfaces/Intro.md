In this class, we are going to talk about classes and interfaces.
Classes and interfaces are the very core of the Java language, or for that matter, any OOP language.
There are many ways to represent objects and implement interfaces.
We are going to take a look at best practices of how to do exactly that, while keeping our code usable, robust, and flexible.
