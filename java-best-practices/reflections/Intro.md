In this class, we are going to talk about reflections.
Reflections are our way to access class methods, fields, constructors, and more, **at runtime**.
We will touch on the following topics:
- What are reflections?
- How do reflections work?
- When can we use reflections?
- Drawbacks of reflections.

Take into account that reflections are very bad for performance and should be avoided for this reason.

Let's go.
