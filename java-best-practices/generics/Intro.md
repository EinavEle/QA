In this lesson, we are going to talk about generics!
Generics make our code much more flexible and pretty.
When done correctly, generics help us write less code and keep everything more organized and reusable.

On the most basic level, generics are a way to specify which types  can be used in a particular class or method. The compiler will also ensure that only your chosen types are used.

We will discuss:
- Generic types
- Lists vs. arrays
- Generic methods
- Wildcards and bounded parameters

Let's go :)
