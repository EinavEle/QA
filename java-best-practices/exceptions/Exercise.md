Write a class that reads a configuration file and saves data to a `Map<String, String>`.
Handle exceptions for:
- Files not found - Create a default config file if none exists.
- Getting the config data when not initialized.
- Requesting a config key that does not exist.
Bonus:
- Any other errors you can come up with.
