In this class we are going to discuss the methods common to all Objects:
- equals()
- toString()
- hashCode()
- clone()
We will see when and how to override them and what are their relevant use cases.

We are also going to discuss Comparable.compareTo() since its functionality fits well with the Object's common methods.
