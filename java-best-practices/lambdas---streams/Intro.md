In this lesson, we are going to talk about some relatively new additions to Java: lambdas, and the very useful stream interface.
We will see how to use lambdas and streams to make our code more flexible and readable, and to allow for a more "functional" programming style.
Topics we will discuss:
- What are functional interfaces?
- Using method references
- The most useful functional interfaces
- How to use streams


Let's go :)
