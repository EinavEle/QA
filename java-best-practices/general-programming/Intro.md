In this lesson we are going to discuss general programing best practices that should make our code more readable, maintainable and efficient.
We will discuss:
- Code reuse.
- Local variable scope.
- For and for-each loops.
- Primitives and boxed primitives.
- Strings.
- Java naming conventions.

Let's go!
