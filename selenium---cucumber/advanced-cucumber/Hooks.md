# *What Are Hooks?*
Hooks are procedures or methods that run before or after each scenario, or before or after the entire test suite. 
They are used to set up the environment before running tests and clean up the environment afterward. 
Hooks are defined in a separate file or class and can be shared across multiple feature files.
# *Difference Between Hooks and Background*
The background is a set of steps that are common to all scenarios in a feature file. 
It's defined at the beginning of the feature file and executed before each scenario. 
Its purpose is to avoid repetitive steps in each scenario and improve the feature file's readability.

Here are the main differences between hooks and background:
1. Scope - Hooks are executed before or after each scenario or before or after the entire test suite, while the background is executed before each scenario.

2. Purpose - Hooks are used to set up and clean up the environment, while the background is used to avoid repetitive steps in each scenario.

3. Definition - Hooks are defined in a separate file or class, while the background is defined at the beginning of the feature file.

4. Usage - Hooks can be shared across multiple feature files, while the background is specific to each feature file.

In summary, hooks are used to set up and clean up the environment, while the background is used to avoid repetitive steps in each scenario. Hooks have a wider scope and can be shared across multiple feature files, while the background is specific to each feature file.
# *Types of hooks*
**Before/After Run**

‘Before All’ and ‘After All’ are hooks that are used to execute a block of code before and after all scenarios in a feature file. These hooks allow developers to perform setup and cleanup activities that are shared across all scenarios in a feature file.

‘Before All’ hook is defined and the code inside the hook is executed only once, before all scenarios in the feature file. 
This hook is commonly used to set up preconditions that are shared across all scenarios, such as initializing a database connection, starting a server, or loading configuration data.

Here is an example of a Before All hook:
```java
import cucumber.api.java.BeforeClass;

public class Hooks {
    @BeforeAll
    public static void setUp() {
        // Initialize database connection
        // Start server
        // Load configuration data
    }
}
```
‘After All’ hook is defined and the code inside the hook is executed only once, after all scenarios in the feature file have been executed. 
This hook is commonly used to perform cleanup activities that are shared across all scenarios, such as stopping a server, closing a database connection, or releasing resources.

Here is an example of an After All hook:
```java
import cucumber.api.java.AfterClass;

public class Hooks {
    @AfterAall
    public static void tearDown() {
        // Stop server
        // Close database connection
        // Release resources
    }
}
```
**Before/After Each**

‘Before Each’ and ‘After Each’ are hooks that are used to execute a block of code before and after each scenario in a feature file. 
These hooks allow developers to perform setup and cleanup activities for each scenario in a feature file.

‘Before Each’ hook is defined with the ‘@Before’ annotation, and the code inside the hook is executed before each scenario in the feature file. 
This hook is commonly used to set up preconditions, such as initializing a browser or setting up test data.

Here is an example of a Before Each hook:
```java
import cucumber.api.java.Before;

public class Hooks {
    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        // Initialize browser
        // Set up test data
    }
}
```
The 'After Each' hook, which is identified by the '@After' annotation, is executed after every scenario in the feature file. It's a convenient tool for performing cleanup tasks like closing a browser, deleting test data, or logging out of an application.

Here is an example of an After Each hook:
```java
import cucumber.api.java.After;

public class Hooks {
    @After
    public void tearDown() {
        // Close browser
        // Delete test data
        // Log out of application
    }
}
```
**Before/After Step**

'Before Step' and 'After Step' are hooks that execute a block of code before and after each step in a scenario. 
These hooks are helpful for developers to perform setup and cleanup activities for every step in a scenario.

The 'Before Step' hook is identified by the '@BeforeStep' annotation and executes the code before each step in a scenario. 
This hook is often used for actions that must be performed before each step, like logging or setting up data.

Here is an example of a Before Step hook:
```java
import cucumber.api.java.BeforeStep;

public class Hooks {
    @BeforeStep
    public void setUp() {
        // Log step information
        // Set up data for step
    }
}
```
The 'After Step' hook is set up using the '@AfterStep' symbol. It runs a piece of code after each step in a scenario. 
This hook is usually utilized to complete tasks that should happen after each step, like checking the step's outcome or capturing a snapshot.

Here is an example of an After Step hook:
```java
import cucumber.api.java.AfterStep;

public class Hooks {
    @AfterStep
    public void tearDown() {
        // Take screenshot of step
        // Verify result of step
    }
}
```
