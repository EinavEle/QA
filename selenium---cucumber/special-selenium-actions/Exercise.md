In this exercise we are going to implement some of the actions we learned, like drag and drop and executing JavaScript.
1. Model this page: https://codepen.io/ovvn/full/Nqxzjg
2. Implement the following actions:
a) Drag and drop (without using the pre-made Selenium Action)
b) Click the trash can (after dropping an item into the right box) by using JavaScript (not element.click())
c) Build an action sequence that opens the details input, clicks it, and adds text into it.
3. Using this page, write a flow that drags some items from left to right and deletes a few of them.
