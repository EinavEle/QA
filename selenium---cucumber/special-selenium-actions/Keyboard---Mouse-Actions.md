# *Why use keyboard and mouse actions?*
Using keyboard and mouse actions can be useful for automating web applications that require user interactions such as filling out forms, clicking buttons, and performing other actions. 

Here are a few reasons why keyboard and mouse actions may be necessary in Selenium:
1. Mimicking user behavior: By using keyboard and mouse actions, you can mimic user behavior more accurately, which can be useful for testing web applications that require user input.

1. Simulating browser events: Some web applications may have custom JavaScript event listeners attached to certain elements that can only be triggered by simulating mouse or keyboard events.

1. Accessing certain elements: Some web elements may be accessible only through certain keyboard or mouse actions, such as hover over or right-click.

1. Enhancing test coverage: By using keyboard and mouse actions, you can increase the test coverage of your Selenium scripts by testing a wider range of scenarios, such as keyboard shortcuts or drag-and-drop interactions.

Although using keyboard and mouse actions in Selenium Java can be useful in certain scenarios, it's generally preferable to use Selenium Actions instead. 

Here are a few reasons why:
1. Cross-browser compatibility: Selenium Actions are designed to work consistently across different browsers, whereas keyboard and mouse actions may behave differently depending on the browser or operating system.

1. Readability and maintainability: Using Selenium Actions can make your code more readable and maintainable by encapsulating the actions into a single object that can be reused and modified as needed.

1. Better performance: In some cases, using Selenium Actions may be faster than using keyboard and mouse actions, since they are implemented natively by Selenium and can take advantage of the underlying browser automation engine.

In summary, while keyboard and mouse actions can be useful in certain scenarios, it's generally better to use Selenium Actions whenever possible for improved cross-browser compatibility, readability, maintainability, debugging, and performance.
# *How To*
A good illustration of this concept is demonstrated in the drag and drop functionality that was previously shown. 
To explain it further, in the initial example, we clicked the mouse on a particular window, then instructed it to move to another element, and finally released the click. Here's what it looked like:
```JavaScript
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
WebElement elementToDrag = 
driver.findElement(By.id("elementIdToDrag"));
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("elementId"));
actions.clickAndHold(element).perform();
actions.moveToElement(elementToDrag).perform();
actions.release().perform();
```
