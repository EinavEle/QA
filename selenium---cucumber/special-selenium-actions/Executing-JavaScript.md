# *Why Use JavaScript in Selenium?*
Executing JavaScript in Selenium using Java can be useful for the following reasons:
- Accessing elements that can't be accessed using Selenium methods
- Performing actions that can't be performed using Selenium methods
- Improving performance for certain operations
- Debugging web pages by executing JavaScript in the browser console

Overall, executing JavaScript in Selenium can be a powerful tool to help you interact with web pages in ways that may not be possible using Selenium methods alone.

# *How to Execute JavaScript in Selenium*
To execute JavaScript in Selenium, you can use the JavacriptExecutor interface that's provided by Selenium. Here's an example:
```JavaScript
JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
// Execute JavaScript code
String title = (String) js.executeScript("return document.title");
// Print the title of the web page
Assert.assertEquals(title,"Test Login | Practice Test Automation");
```
In our example, we retrieve the title of a web page using JavaScript code and then perform an assertion on it.
