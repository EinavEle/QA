To follow our guidelines of hybrid testing, meaning combining API calls with UI actions and validations, we have provided you with example code that shows how we can transfer the session from the APIto the UI.
This code is a simple script and does not follow the guidelines of correct architecture, encapsulation, separations of concerns and many other things.
You should not use this code in your project as is but use it to understand the process and implement on your own.

In the example you can see how the user 'Tzahi' is logged in via API and then the relevant data is transferred to the browser.
After the page is refreshed 'Tzahi' is logged in in the browser.
