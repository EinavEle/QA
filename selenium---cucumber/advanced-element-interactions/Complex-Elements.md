To find elements within another element, you can use the findElement() method of the WebElement class.
This method helps locate a child element within a parent element using locators like ID, class name, tag name, and more.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to locate an element within another element in Selenium Java:
```Java
// Find the parent element
WebElement parentElement = driver.findElement(By.id("parent-id"));

// Find the child element within the parent element
WebElement childElement = parentElement.findElement(By.className("child-class"));

// Interact with the child element
childElement.click();
```
In the above code, we first locate the parent element using its ID and store it in the parentElement variable.
Then we locate the child element within the parent element using its class name and store it in the childElement variable. 
Finally, we interact with the child element by clicking on it.
# *"Component"*
To create a reusable element or group of elements in your application, you can define a "component" as a class or function. Here are the basic steps:
1. Identify the common identifiers: Note the shared HTML tags, attributes, and other identifiers for the element(s) you want to make a component for.

1. Create the class or function: Define a class or function that represents the component and its methods, using the Selenium WebDriver API to interact with its elements.

1. Implement the methods: Define methods that locate and manipulate the relevant elements, performing actions like clicking a button or filling out a form.
1. Instantiate the component: Create an instance of the component or call its function whenever you need to use it in your tests, allowing you to reuse the same methods for different instances of the element(s) in your application.
 
For example:

First, we create a login class:
```Java
public class LoginClass {

    private WebDriver driver;
    private By usernameField = By.id("username");
    private By passwordField = By.name("password");
    private By loginButton = By.className("btn");

    public LoginClass(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
    public void login(String username, String password) {
           Driver
             .get(
              "https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/");
        WebElement usernameInput = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
                                      .until(ExpectedConditions
                                      .presenceOfElementLocated
                                                         (usernameField));
        usernameInput.sendKeys(username);
        WebElement passwordInput = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
                                       .until(ExpectedConditions
                                       .presenceOfElementLocated
                                                         (passwordField));
        passwordInput.sendKeys(password);
        WebElement loginButtonElement = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
                                         .until(ExpectedConditions
                                         .presenceOfElementLocated
                                                        (loginButton));
        loginButtonElement.click();
    }
}
```
Then, we can instantiate an object of this class and invoke the login method.
```Java
public static void useComponent(){
      WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
      LoginClass loginClass = new LoginClass(driver);
      loginClass.login("student","Password123");
      driver.quit();
}
```
