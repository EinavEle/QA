If we need to work with lists or tables, we can search for the elements we need.
This lets us access each element in the list and work with them. 
We use a locator strategy to find the elements we want. 
When we find them, we get back a list of "WebElement" objects that match the locator. 
If we can't find any elements, we'll get an empty list.

Here's the syntax for the findElements method:
```Java
List<WebElement> elements = driver.findElements(By.class("locatorValue"));
```
Let's break down this syntax:

- driver is an instance of the WebDriver interface, which is used to interact with the browser.

- By.id is the locator strategy used to find the elements. Some of the commonly used locator strategies are By.name, By.className, By.tagName, By.linkText, By.partialLinkText, and By.xpath.

- "locatorValue" is the value of the locator. It could be the ID, name, class name, tag name, link text, partial link text, or XPath expression, depending on the locator strategy.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the findElements method to find all the links on a webpage:
```Java
// Find all the links on the webpage
List<WebElement> links = driver.findElements(By.tagName("a"));

// Print the number of links found
System.out.println("Number of links found: " + links.size());

// Print the text of each link
for (WebElement link : links) {
    System.out.println(link.getText());
}
```
In this example, we use the findElements method with the By.tagName locator strategy to find all the links on the webpage. 
We store the results in a List<WebElement> variable named links.
We then print the number of links found and the text of each link using a for loop.

It is possible to combine all the elements, which will allow us to work with tables. We can search for a table using findElement, and for our result we can retrieve all the rows using findElements, as in the following example:
```Java
// Find the table element by ID
WebElement table = driver.findElement(By.id("table1"));

// Find all the rows in the table
List<WebElement> rows = table.findElements(By.tagName("tr"));

// Iterate through each row and print the data in the columns
for (WebElement row : rows) {
    List<WebElement> cols = row.findElements(By.tagName("td"));
    for (WebElement col : cols) {
        System.out.print(col.getText() + "\t");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```
In this example, we locate the table element by its ID using the findElement method. 
Then, we find all the rows in the table using the findElements method with By.tagName("tr").
We loop through each row and find all the columns using the findElements method with By.
tagName("td"). 
We extract the data from each column and print it to the console.

Another thing to note is that if we want to target a specific element within a table, we can further refine our locator. 

We can use the methods we've learned:
- Performing actions on a list or table: You can use Selenium's click() method to click on an element or sendKeys() method to send text to an element. 
- For tables, you can locate individual cells or rows using their XPath and perform actions on them.

For example, suppose we have a table with an ID of "table-id". We can locate a specific cell in the table and perform an action on it using the following code:
```Java
WebElement table = driver.findElement(By.id("table-id"));
WebElement cell = table.findElement(By.xpath(".//tr[.//span[contains(‘Atlanta’)]]/td[5]"));
cell.click();
```
In this example, we first locate the table element by its ID using the findElement() method and then locate the cell using its XPath using the findElement() method again. 
Finally, we perform an action (in this case, a click) on the cell using its click() method.
