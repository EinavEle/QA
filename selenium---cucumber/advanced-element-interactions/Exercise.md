In this exercise we are going to implement the things we learned in the advanced element interactions lesson.

**eBay Advanced Search**
1. Use page object model to model the advanced search page of eBay at this address:
https://www.ebay.com/sch/ebayadvsearch
1. Make every form section a component (keywords, search including, price, buying format, etc..)
1. Use the appropriate Selenium actions (Select/isChecked/etc..)
1. Use enum for known options.
For example your selectCondition method should only accept New/Used/NotSpecified and not any String
1. Make your functions as generic as you can
1. Use base classes and inheritance where appropriate
