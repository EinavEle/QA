BDD, or Behavior Driven Development, is a software development method that helps technical and non-technical team members work together by using a common language and goals. 

Cucumber is a widely-used tool for BDD that uses a simple language called Gherkin to describe the system's behavior from different perspectives, like end-users or business analysts.

By using examples or scenarios, team members can illustrate how the system should behave in different situations. 
These scenarios are written using a special language called Gherkin, which is easy to understand for both technical and non-technical team members.

BDD testing involves writing automated tests that check whether the system behaves correctly according to the scenarios that were written in Gherkin. This helps to make sure that the software being developed meets the needs of the people who will be using it, and that it works correctly under different conditions.
