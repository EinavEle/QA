# What are .spec files
- In software testing, a .spec file is a file that contains specifications or tests for a software component or system.
- .spec files are typically used in testing frameworks such as Playwright.
- Each .spec file typically contains one or more test suites, which are groups of related tests that are run together.

Here's an example of how to create a simple test suite:
```Playwright
test.describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  test('Test Case 1', async () => {
    // Test logic goes here
  });

  test('Test Case 2', async () => {
    // Test logic goes here
  });
});

```
In this example, we use the Jest testing framework to define a test suite called "My Test Suite" using the describe() function. 
We then define two test cases using the test() function.

Each test case contains the logic for a single test. 
For example, in the first test case, we might interact with a web page using Playwright to verify that a button click triggers a specific behavior.

When we run our test suite using Jest, it will execute each test case and report the results. We can use the results to determine whether our software component or system is behaving correctly.

# Test Structure
- To create a new test suite in Playwright, you can use the describe() function, which takes two parameters: 
a string describing the suite, and a function containing the tests.
- Within each test suite, you can use the test() function to define individual tests. The test() function also takes two parameters:
 a string describing the test, and a function containing the test logic.
- You can use various hooks to control the behavior of your tests in Playwright. 
For example, the beforeAll() and afterAll() hooks run once before and after all tests in the suite, respectively, while the beforeEach() and afterEach() hooks run before and after each test, respectively.
- In addition to these built-in constructs, you can also create your own custom hooks using the beforeEach and afterEach functions. These allow you to define setup and teardown logic that runs before and after each test.

Here's an example of how to structure a test suite:
```Playwright
import { test, expect, Browser, Page } from '@playwright/test';
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

test.describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  let browser: Browser;
  let page: Page;
  test.beforeAll(async () => {
    browser = await chromium.launch();
  });
  test.beforeEach(async () => {
    page = await browser.newPage();
  });
  test.afterEach(async () => {
    await page.close();
  });
  test.afterAll(async () => {
    await browser.close();
  });
  test('should navigate to Google', async () => {
    await page.goto('https://google.com');
    expect(await page.title()).toBe('Google');
  });
  test('should search for Playwright', async () => {
    await page.goto('https://google.com');
    const input = page.locator('input[name="q"]');
    await input.fill('Playwright');
    await input.press('Enter');
    expect(await page.title()).toContain('Playwright');
  });
});
```
In this example, we define a test suite using the describe() function, and use various hooks such as beforeAll(), beforeEach(), afterEach(), and afterAll() to control the behavior of our tests.

Within the suite, we define two individual tests using the test() function, each containing Playwright code to navigate to a website and perform an action. 
We use the expect() function from a test library like Jest or Jasmine to make assertions about the behavior of the test.

By using a structured test suite like this, we can easily organize and run our tests, and ensure that our code behaves as expected in a variety of scenarios.
