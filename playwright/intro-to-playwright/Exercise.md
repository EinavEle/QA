## In this exercise we will implement some form validation tests

We will test this site: https://www.activetrail.com/free-trial/

### Exercise
A.  Write tests to verify the error messages in this form
Example: when I input an illegal email address I see this error: “Please enter a correct email address or email is too long.”

B. Test the following fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Email
&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Password
&nbsp;&nbsp;c. First Name
&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Telephone number
&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Terms and conditions

C. Write tests for legal values, illegal values, and missing values
* Note that to see the error for missing fields you need to try and submit the form

D.  Split the tests into different .spec files as you see fit
