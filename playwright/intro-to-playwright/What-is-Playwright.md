# What is Playwright And How it Beganâ€¦
- Playwright is an open-source Node.js library that automates web browsers, allowing developers to streamline their tasks across multiple browsers such as Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- The project was created by Microsoft in 2019, building upon the success of Puppeteer, a similar library developed by Google in 2017.
- Puppeteer provided an API to control headless Chrome, but its limited support for only Chromium-based browsers prompted Microsoft to create Playwright.
- Playwright has features like automatic network request waiting and reliable file uploads that were not present in Puppeteer, making it a powerful and convenient tool for developers.
- As a result, Playwright has gained popularity in the development community due to its flexibility, powerful automation capabilities, and user-friendly interface.
