# Test Plan
The first part of the final project is designing a test plan.
This plan should include the test plan document with the following data:
- Introduction
- Scope
- Objectives
- Approach
- Resources
- Schedule
- Deliverables

The second document is the list of test cases which should provide sanity coverage for the product you are testing.
You should have at least 5 manual "flow" tests that will later be broken down into automatic tests

Examples of these documents:

- [Test cases](https://tractorfast-politicjames.codio.io/.guides/img/TestCases.pdf)
