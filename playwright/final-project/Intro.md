# Intro
We have talked a lot about Playwright now it's time to put it all together!
In this project we will write a test plan, develop automation infrastructure, and implement all kinds of test.
We will use best practices of test automation and of the tools we learned.

We will be testing the following site:
[Terminal X](https://www.terminalx.com/)

You can choose your own site to perform test on assuming it answers the following criteria:
- You need to be logged in
- You can make api calls and see their effect in the website
- You have enough content to test
