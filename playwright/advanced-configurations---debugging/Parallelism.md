# Intro
Parallelism refers to the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In the context of testing with Playwright, running tests in a parallel means executing multiple tests at once.

So, when using Playwright, you can choose to run the test multiple times at the same time (in parallel) or one after the other (sequentially).

Running in parallel helps us reduce running times significantly.

Another thing that is important in planning all our tests is to notice that we apply an important principle in automation and that is "test independence" so that we can really run in parallel and no test will depend on another test and thus the parallelism will really work properly for us.

# Parallel/Fully Parallel
- Parallelism in testing can be categorized into two types: parallel and fully parallel.
- Parallel testing involves running multiple test cases simultaneously on separate machines or environments.
- It is beneficial for distributed testing to save time by using different machines for different tests.
- Playwright Test achieves parallel test execution by utilizing multiple worker processes that run simultaneously, allowing test files to be executed in parallel, while tests within a single file are executed sequentially within the same worker process..
- It can be faster but requires more resources and careful management to avoid conflicts and ensure consistent results.
- In summary, parallel testing uses separate machines or environments, while fully parallel testing runs multiple tests on the same machine or environment.

# Serial
In Playwright Test, you can use test.describe.serial() to group dependent tests together, making sure they always run in order. If one test fails, all the following tests in that group are skipped. Plus, the whole group of tests gets retried together. 

This helps maintain the right sequence, avoid issues with failed tests, and improve the reliability of your testing process.
