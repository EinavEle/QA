# What is the Config playwright file?
playwright.config.ts is a configuration file that is used to customize the behavior of the Playwright test runner.
It should be located in the root of your project and named playwright.config.ts. 
The file should export a configuration object that contains various options that you can use to customize the behavior of the test runner.

# The file with explanations
```Playwright
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  /* Run tests in files in parallel */
  fullyParallel: false,
  /* Fail the build on CI if you accidentally left test.
                                        only in the source code. */
  //forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  /* Retry on CI only */
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  /* Opt out of parallel tests on CI. */
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : 1,
  /* Reporter to use. 
                    See https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters */
  reporter: 'html',
  /* Shared settings for all the projects below. 
                    See https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions. */
  use: {
    /* Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`. */
    // baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 1024 },
    /* Collect trace when retrying the failed test. 
                            See https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer */
    trace: 'on',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    headless: false
  },

  /* Configure projects for major browsers */
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },

    // {
    //   name: 'firefox',
    //   use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    // },

    // {
    //   name: 'webkit',
    //   use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    // },
  ]
});
```

We will go into more details for some of these configurations and there are more details in Playwrightâ€™s documentation if you need it.
