# When should you use javascript
JavaScript can be used in playwright for a variety of reasons, such as interacting with elements on a webpage, performing calculations or data manipulations, and automating tasks that require dynamic functionality. It can also be used to add custom functionality to your tests.

Overall, using JavaScript in playwright can help you create more robust and flexible tests, and can make it easier to accomplish complex tasks within your automation scripts.

# Implementation
To execute JavaScript in playwright, you can simply use the ‘evaluate()’ function and pass in the JavaScript code as a string.

```Playwright
  test(`Executing JavaScript`, async () => {
        await page.goto('https:///www.google.com')
        // Execute JavaScript code on the page
        const pageTitle = await page.evaluate(() => {
            return document.title;
        });
        console.log(`The page title is: ${pageTitle}`);
    })
```
