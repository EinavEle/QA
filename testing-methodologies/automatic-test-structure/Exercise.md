In this exercise we will develop tests according to the structure we have learned.

1. Write tests for the football team exercise - you may need to fix issues in your exercise code when writing the tests because your tests may find bugs.

2. Your tests should follow the AAA structure

3. Tests should be small (atomic) and independent

4. Use hooks for setup/teardown where appropriate

5. Use the most accurate assertions (not only assertTrue())

6. Write positive and negative tests

7. Write separate tests (in separate classes) for different classes of your exercise (player, team, etc..)

8. Write at least one parameterized test

9. You do not need to test private functions

**Bonus**

10. Add hamcrest assertions and find more accurate tests and assertions
