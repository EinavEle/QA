# What is Testing?
Testing is the process of checking if something works as expected.
In software development, it means evaluating software to find mistakes or issues. 
There are different types of testing done at different stages of development. 

# Why are Tests Important?
Tests are essential to ensure the software works correctly, is reliable, and meets user expectations. 
They help identify and fix errors before they impact users. 
By catching problems early, tests can save time and money by reducing the cost of fixing issues in later stages of development.
# What are the Goals of Testing?
- To ensure that the software works as intended.
- To identify and fix bugs, errors, and other issues.
- To improve the quality and reliability of the software.
- To ensure that the software meets user requirements.
- To increase user satisfaction and trust in the software.

By achieving these goals, testing ensures that the software is of high quality, meets user needs, and performs well in different scenarios.
