Write tests of each type we discussed for adding a post to favorites on the Yad2 site.

**Unit Tests** - I will write a test that sends a string to the function instead of a number that updates the price of the product and make sure that it does not return a correct result.

**Integration Tests** - I will send through the api an update to the ad that adds it to the favorites and I will expect to see the ad marked as a favorite in the ui.

**System Testing** - As system tests I can check the options to save the ad in favorites in different browsers and see that it responds as expected
