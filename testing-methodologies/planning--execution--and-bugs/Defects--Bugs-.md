# What is a Bug?
A bug is a software defect or flaw that causes an application or system to behave in an unintended or unexpected way. 
It can be a coding error, design flaw, or any other type of issue that impacts the functionality, performance, or security of software. 
Bugs can range from minor issues that cause inconvenience to major problems that can result in system crashes, data loss, or security breaches. 
The process of identifying and fixing bugs is an essential part of software testing and development.
For example, Let's say you're testing a website that allows users to upload profile pictures. You notice that when you try to upload a photo that's larger than 5MB, the website crashes and gives you an error message. This is a bug because the website should be able to handle larger file sizes and provide a helpful error message to the user.
# Bug Description
When describing a bug, it is important to provide enough information to help the developer understand and reproduce the issue. Here are some tips:

1. Title: Provide a brief, descriptive title that summarizes the issue.

2. Steps to reproduce: List the steps that led to the bug. Be as specific as possible and include any relevant information, such as the browser, operating system, and device used.

3. Expected result: Describe what you expected to happen.

4. Actual result: Describe what actually happened.

5. Environment: Operating system, browser, versions of tools we used, everything that can help investigate the bug

6. Impact: Explain the impact of the bug, such as how it affects the user experience or functionality of the software.

7. Severity: Assess the severity of the bug, such as how critical it is to fix and how it affects the software's overall performance.

8. Attachments: If applicable, include screenshots, error messages, or any other relevant attachments that can help the developer understand the issue.

Overall, the bug description should be clear, concise, and detailed enough to help the developer identify and fix the issue.
