# Stages of Test Execution

The Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern is a useful approach for structuring test cases. It consists of three stages in the following order:

- **Arrange**: Prepare the test inputs and any necessary targets or objects.
 This stage involves setting up the test case, including any required objects, data, or special settings. It may involve preparing a database or logging into a web application.

- **Act**: Perform the actions on the target behavior. 
The act stage should cover the primary aspect of the test, such as calling a function or method, interacting with a web page, or calling a REST API. Keep the actions focused on the target behavior.

- **Assert**: Verify the expected outcomes. 
This stage involves checking the response and verifying its correctness. Assertions may involve simple checks on numeric or string values, or they may require checking multiple facets of a system. The assertions determine whether the test passes or fails.
