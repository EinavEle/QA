# What is SDLC?
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. 
It is a process used by software development teams to design, develop, and maintain high-quality software products. 
The SDLC provides a framework for creating software that meets customer requirements, is delivered on time and within budget, and is easy to maintain and update.

The SDLC is an important process for software development as it provides a structured approach to software development, helps to identify and mitigate risks, and ensures that the final software product is of high quality and meets customer requirements.
# Stages of SDLC
The SDLC typically consists of the following phases:

1. Planning: In this phase, the project scope, requirements, and timelines are defined, and the project team is assembled.

2. Analysis: In this phase, the project requirements are analyzed, and a detailed functional specification is created.

3. Design: In this phase, the system architecture, software design, and database design are developed based on the functional specification.

4. Implementation: In this phase, the software is developed, tested, and integrated.

5. **Testing: In this phase, the software is tested to ensure it meets the requirements and is ready for deployment.**

6. Deployment: In this phase, the software is deployed to the production environment.

7. Maintenance: In this phase, the software is monitored and updated to ensure it continues to meet the customer's needs.
# Where Does Testing Fit in SDLC?

Testing is an essential part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and is integrated throughout the entire process. Testing is performed in each phase of the SDLC to ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements, is of high quality, and is ready for deployment.
During this phase, the testing team performs system testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing to ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and is ready for deployment.
In summary, testing is an integral part of the SDLC, and it ensures that the software is of high quality, meets the customer's requirements, and is ready for deployment. Testing is performed in each phase of the SDLC to ensure that the software meets the required standards and is ready to be used by the end-users.
