In this exercise we are going to design a test plan for a single feature.

This is the site we are going to test: [https://www.ebay.com/sch/ebayadvsearch]


1. Write a test plan for the eBay advanced search feature.

2. Your plan should include only system tests (not unit/integration tests).

3. All tests should be “black box” since we don’t have access to eBays code.

4. Make sure you include tests of different types (functional, usability, localization, etc..)
a) You can skip security tests

5. Make sure you include tests of different techniques and add examples of the following:
a) Decision table
b) Equivalence partitioning
