# API tests intro
API tests check how well APIs work by sending requests and verifying responses. They ensure APIs function correctly, handle errors, and provide data security. 
Types of API tests include functional, performance, security, load, and mock tests. 
Tools like Postman are used for testing. 
API tests are vital for reliable and scalable applications, finding issues early, and ensuring smooth operation.
API tests have a major benefit: they're super fast and provide precise information tailored to our testing requirements. 
The problems with these tests are that they go straight to the end point and sometimes you have to touch all the contact points throughout the process at the end of which the reading is done.
# UI tests intro
UI tests check how well the user interface works, ensuring it's user-friendly and functional. They simulate user actions and cover navigation, input validation, error handling, and data display. 
These tests can be automated, saving time and effort. 
UI tests include functional, usability, cross-browser/platform and responsive design. 
They ensure quality and a good user experience. Automating UI tests is efficient and reduces errors.
The advantages of these tests are that we simulate a real user and real activity in front of the application, the disadvantages are that these tests take a lot of time, so we strive to perform hybrid tests as we will explain later.
# Hybrid tests
Hybrid tests combine API and UI testing to ensure smooth integration. 
They check API functionality, user interactions, and appearance. 
These tests are crucial for applications relying on APIs. 
They validate data consistency, input, errors, and performance. 
By testing both parts, hybrid tests provide a comprehensive view of the system,
In addition to the comprehensive tests of the system, a combination allows us to create more stable and faster tests by preparing in advance the data needed for testing through the api and using it in the ui.
Usually we strive to prepare/produce the required data through the api interfaces and the actions tested through the ui.
# Why should we combine API with UI
1. Ensures smooth integration: Hybrid tests make sure that the API and UI work seamlessly together.
2. Supports API-reliant applications: Hybrid tests are vital for applications relying heavily on APIs. They validate data consistency, input handling, error management, and performance.
3. Offers a complete view of the system: By combining API and UI testing, we gain a holistic understanding of the entire system, identifying potential issues resulting from API-UI differences.
4. Improves stability and efficiency: Over time, combining API with UI testing leads to more stable and efficient tests. By preparing data through APIs for UI testing, the process becomes streamlined and faster.
