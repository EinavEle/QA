# What are sleeps
In automation testing, "sleeps" refer to adding pauses in the test script. It's like pressing the pause button for a specific amount of time. Sleeps are used to wait for things to load, process data, or handle delays. They help keep the test script in sync with the application being tested. 
# The problems with using sleeps in testing
However, sleep should be used wisely to avoid slowing down the automation process. It's important to consider other synchronization techniques whenever possible.
We will always prefer to wait for the element for a certain time, and if this does not happen, we will stop the test and figure out where the problem is.
# What are retries
Retries in automation testing mean giving a failed action another chance. It's like a do-over when something goes wrong. 
They help make tests more reliable.
Using retries can be helpful when we anticipate potential failures due to dependencies on other systems or when an operation might take time. 
However, it's important to exercise caution and apply retries in a controlled manner, even in such situations.
# How to use retries
To use retries effectively in automation testing:

1. Identify problematic areas: Find the steps or actions that sometimes fail or have issues.
1. Set retry count: Decide how many times you want to retry those steps or actions.
1. Implement retry logic: Wrap the steps or actions in a loop that repeats until they succeed or reach the maximum retries.
1. Add a short wait: Pause between each retry to allow for a possible fix or resolution.
1. Log failure details: Capture and log information about the failures for analysis.
1. Investigate failures: Analyze the patterns and investigate why the failures occurred.
# Retry scope
Retry scope in automation testing depends on the situation. Generally, it's not recommended to retry the whole test. Retrying the entire test suggests that the test itself is unstable.

Instead, it's better to focus on retrying specific actions or steps within the test. This approach allows you to isolate and address the intermittent failures without compromising the overall stability of the test.

Consider factors like the stability of the test environment and the impact of retries on test results. Make sure that retries don't hide real failures or give misleading results.
