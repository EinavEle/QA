# What is “Fail Fast”?
"Fail Fast" means that tests are designed to quickly detect and report failures or errors during the test execution. It involves setting up tests in a way that allows immediate identification of issues, helping testers promptly investigate and resolve them. By failing fast in automation testing, the focus is on catching problems early, which saves time and effort by addressing issues sooner rather than later.
# How it is relevant to testing
Here's why "Fail Fast" is important in testing:

1. Catching Bugs Early: Failing fast helps testers catch bugs and issues as soon as they happen. This helps understand the causes and fix them quickly, minimizing the impact on the system.

2. Swift Feedback: Failing fast gives immediate feedback to testers. They can assess the test results quickly and make necessary changes, like modifying test cases or investigating further.

3. Effective Troubleshooting: Early identification of failures allows testers to focus on troubleshooting and resolving issues. This saves time and resources compared to finding the causes later in the testing process.

4. Cost Savings: Detecting and fixing failures early saves costs. It's cheaper to address issues in the early stages of testing rather than later in the development or deployment phases.
