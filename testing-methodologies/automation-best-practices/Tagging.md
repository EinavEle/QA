# Why and how to use tags in your tests 
Tags are essential for organizing and managing tests effectively. Here's why and how to use them:

Why use tags:

1. Categorization: Tags help categorize tests based on functionality, priority, or test type, making it easier to navigate and filter tests.

2. Test Selection: Tags allow you to selectively run specific groups of tests, such as regression, smoke tests, or tests for specific modules or environments.

3. Prioritization: Assigning tags helps prioritize tests based on importance or criticality, ensuring high-priority tests receive attention when time is limited.

4. Configuration: Tags enable customized test execution behavior, such as setting up specific environments or test data associated with each tag.
# 3 Tag layers
1. Test Status: Use tags like "Stable," "Bug," or "WIP" to indicate the test's status, providing valuable information about its reliability or progress.
2. Feature/Module: Categorize tests with tags like "Login," "Upload," "Registration," or "Share" to focus on specific functionalities during test execution.
3. Test Properties: Apply tags like "Slow," "Restarts," "NoParallel," "NoCI," or "Stress" to handle tests differently based on their specific requirements or characteristics.

How to use tags:

1. Categorize Tests: Assign relevant tags to tests based on their status, feature/module, and properties.
2. Test Selection: Choose which tests to run by utilizing tags that match specific criteria or properties.
3. Filtering and Grouping: Use tags to filter and group tests, enabling focused execution or analysis.
4. Prioritization: Prioritize tests based on their status or criticality using tags.
5. Customization: Customize test execution or configurations based on specific tags, such as defining different environments or CI/CD pipeline rules.
