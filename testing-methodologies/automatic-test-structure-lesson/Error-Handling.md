# *Assertion Error vs. Other Errors*
Error handling is the process of managing and responding to unexpected or exceptional conditions that occur during the execution of a test. It involves identifying, capturing, and properly dealing with errors to ensure the stability, reliability, and graceful functioning of the software.

The difference between an assertion error and other errors lies in their purpose and usage:
1. Assertion Error: Assertion errors occur when an assertion statement fails during the execution of a test. They are used to validate expected behavior. Assertion errors indicate that a condition that was expected to be true during testing is actually false.
1. Other Errors: Other errors refer to general runtime errors or exceptions that can occur in a program during its execution. These errors are not limited to testing scenarios and can happen in various parts of the application. They can be caused by issues such as incorrect input, resource unavailability, programming errors, or external factors. Examples of other errors include NullPointerException, IOException, or ArithmeticException. These errors typically require appropriate error handling techniques, such as exception handling, to gracefully handle and recover from the error condition.

# *What Should You do With Errors*
When encountering errors, follow these practices:

**Log**: Capture error details like messages and timestamps for analysis.

**Report**: Implement error reporting to centralize and prioritize fixes.

**Debug**: Collect additional information, such as variables and code paths.

**Screenshots**: Capture visuals to provide context for UI-related issues.

**Handle**: Use try-catch blocks and informative messages for graceful error handling.

These steps help diagnose and resolve errors efficiently.

For example:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class ExampleTest {

    @Test
    public void testDivision() {
        int numerator = 10;
        int denominator = 2;

        try {
            int result = divide(numerator, denominator);
            assertEquals(5, result, "Division result should be 5");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            fail("Division by zero occurred");
        }
    }

    public int divide(int numerator, int denominator) {
        if (denominator == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
        return numerator / denominator;
    }
}
```
In this example, we have a test method testDivision that tests the divide method. 
The test case verifies that the division operation between numerator and denominator produces the expected result of 5.

To handle the potential error of division by zero, we use a try-catch block. Inside the try block, we perform the division operation and assert the result. 
If an ArithmeticException is thrown due to division by zero, the catch block is executed, and the test fails using the fail method.

By incorporating error handling in the test, we ensure that any potential errors are caught and properly handled, allowing the test to provide accurate feedback on the division operation while avoiding test failures due to exceptions.
