# *What is an autonomous test?*
An autonomous test, also called an independent or isolated test, is a test that can do its job without needing anything else. 
It doesn't depend on other tests or external stuff to work properly.

In an autonomous test, everything it needs is right there in the test itself. 
It doesn't care about the order of other tests or what they do. It's a self-sufficient test that can stand on its own.

The cool thing about autonomous tests is that they make debugging and troubleshooting easier. 
If something goes wrong, you can focus on that specific test without worrying about how it interacts with other tests.

Keeping tests independent and isolated also means you can update or change them without messing up the whole testing process. 
And guess what? You can run multiple autonomous tests at the same time without any conflicts.

So, an autonomous test is like a solo star â€” it does its thing independently and gives you reliable results without relying on anything else.
# *Why do we need our tests to be independent?*
Independent tests bring several benefits to the testing process:
1. Clear Issue Identification: Independent tests make it easier to find and understand issues. When a test fails, you can quickly see which specific part of the software is causing the problem.
1. Faster Debugging: Independent tests speed up debugging. Since each test stands on its own, you can focus on fixing one problem without getting distracted by others.
1. Easy Maintenance: Independent tests are easier to update and maintain. They are like building blocks that can be changed without affecting the whole testing process.
1. Parallel Execution: Independent tests can be run simultaneously, saving time. You can execute multiple tests at once without worrying about them interfering with each other.
1. Reusability: Independent tests can be reused in different situations. You can use them across various test suites or frameworks, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.
1. Better Test Coverage: Independent tests ensure that specific parts of the software are thoroughly tested. They cover different behaviors and edge cases and scenarios, giving you more confidence in the quality of your software.

In summary, independent tests make issue identification easier, speed up debugging, simplify maintenance, allow parallel execution, enable reusability, and improve test coverage. They make testing more effective and efficient overall.
# *How to make a test independent?*
To make a test independent, you can follow these steps:

**Configuration:**
Ensure that the test is not dependent on specific configurations or environment settings. Provide any necessary configuration within the test itself or use configuration files specifically designed for the test environment.

**Data Creation:**
Let the test create its own data instead of relying on existing data or external sources. 
This ensures that the test has complete control over the data it needs and eliminates dependencies on external data sources.

**Dependency Management:**
Utilize dependency management tools like Maven, npm, or similar frameworks to handle all required dependencies automatically. 
This ensures that the test has all the necessary dependencies available without the need for separate manual installations.

**Context Isolation:**
Ensure that each test runs in its own isolated context without sharing data or states with other tests. 
This prevents interference and allows each test to execute independently, providing reliable and consistent results.

By incorporating these practices, you can create independent tests that are not reliant on specific configurations, and can generate their own data, handle dependencies seamlessly, and execute in isolated contexts. 
This enhances the independence, reliability, and maintainability of your tests.
# *Examples*
**The Bad Way**
```java
@Test
public void calculateTotalPrice_ShouldReturnCorrectValue() {
    // Arrange
    ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
    // Assume the cart already has items added 
                                     by a previous test or external setup
    // Act
    double totalPrice = cart.calculateTotalPrice();
    // Assert
    assertEquals(16.98, totalPrice, 0.01);
}
```
In this example, the test is not independent. It assumes that the shopping cart already has items added, possibly by a previous test or external setup. 
This introduces a dependency on external factors, making the test unreliable and harder to maintain.

**The Good Way**
```java
@Test
public void calculateTotalPrice_ShouldReturnCorrectValue() {
    // Arrange
    ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
    cart.addItem(new Item("Product A", 10.99));
    cart.addItem(new Item("Product B", 5.99));
    // Act
    double totalPrice = cart.calculateTotalPrice();
    // Assert
    assertEquals(16.98, totalPrice, 0.01);
}
```
In this example, the test is independent and isolated. 
It creates its own data (shopping cart and items) and performs the necessary calculations. It doesn't rely on external resources, other tests, or shared states.
