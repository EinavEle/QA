API  (Application Programming Interfaces) testing is basically testing the interface that lets different software programs talk to each other. 
Think of it like a phone call: the API is the phone line that allows two different people (or programs) to communicate.
API testing makes sure that this phone line is working properly by checking that the API does what it's supposed to do, is fast enough, doesn't break down, and keeps your data safe.
People do API testing either by clicking around manually or by using automated tools to run tests. This kind of testing is really important because it helps to find and fix problems before they cause bigger issues. 
It's like checking your car's engine before you take a road trip - you don't want to end up stranding on the side of the road!
