Today we will learn another JavaScript running environment.
The first place we can run JavaScript code is the browser. But this is not the only option to run JavaScript.
We can also use NodeJS.


In this lesson we will cover the following introductory concepts to Node JS:

-   What Node is
-   JS vs. Node
-   Running Node code
-   Debugging using VS Code
-   Modules in Node: exporting and requiring them

  

So let's go.

#### **NODE JS**

  

Node JS (a.k.a Node.js, node.js, node js) is another **JavaScript runtime environment** - this just means that it's somewhere we can run JS code that's not the browser. We'll just call it Node* for simplicity.

###### *A lot of developers will say that they know _node_, or they _write_ node, but what they mean is that they work in a node _environment_ - the actual coding language is still _JavaScript_

  

Among other things, Node allows us to:

-   Run JS code
-   Use external libraries
-   Write in modules
