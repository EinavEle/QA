Here is a simplified overview of Appium's architecture:

- Appium Server: The Appium server is a web server that listens for requests from the Appium client. It is responsible for handling all communication between the client and the device.
- Appium Client: The Appium client is a program that communicates with the Appium server. It is responsible for sending commands to the device and receiving results from the server.
- Device: The device is the actual mobile device that is being automated. 
It can be an iOS device, an Android device.

When you run an Appium test, the following happens:

1. The Appium client sends a command to the Appium server.
1. The Appium server sends the command to the device.
1. The device executes the command and sends the results back to the Appium server.
1. The Appium server sends the results back to the Appium client.
1. The Appium client displays the results to the user.

Appium uses a variety of drivers to communicate with devices. 
For iOS devices, Appium uses the XCUITest driver. 
For Android devices, Appium uses the UiAutomator2 driver.
