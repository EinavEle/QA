In this exercise we are going to play a bit with Appium tests


## Exercise 1

- Write a few tests on the android settings app

- Examples:
1. Open “settings”
1. Click display
1. Turn “Auto rotate screen” off
1. Validate “Auto rotate screen” is off

- Make sure your tests are independent

- Make sure your tests are atomic

- Write at least one parameterized test

- Write at least one test that inputs text

- You don’t have to write a complete infrastructure for this exercise
